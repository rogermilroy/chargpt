# chargpt

---

## A simple character level GPT for learning and experimentation. 

This repo was created originally following along with Andrej Karpathy's video [Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) and subsequently continued with. 

The goal of the repo is to learn more about Transformers in general, test out good training pipelines, experiment with different techniques and generally to explore but within the context of the original model - ie character level GPTs. I may add some different tokenizers or datasets for testing and comparison at some stage though.
